# typescript-starter-template
Depa grew tired of configuring typescript projects, so this is his attempt to do it once

This repository provides starter templates designed to help quickly bootstrap TypeScript projects. It includes a pre-configured setup with ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and a sample project structure.

Nothing fancy, you are free to pick whatever you need.
